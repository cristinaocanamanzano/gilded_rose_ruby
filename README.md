Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata
==========
This project consists of a proposed solution to the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata in Ruby.

Specifications
-------
The challenge consists of refactoring the original code so that its design is improved in such a way that adding new functionality is easy.

To do so, any changes can be made to the update_quality method, but no changes can be made to the Item class or the items property.
